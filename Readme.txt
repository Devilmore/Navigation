Purpose of this project:

Development of navigation software for single-steering multi-axle vehicles driving in reverse, using machine-learning algorithms.
The purpose of this program is to incorporate the given assisted-steering software of the workgroup Echtzeitsysteme into a tool that allows for planning and visualization of a path from a given starting position to a given ending position for a vehicle based on a 1:16 scale model.
The path is to be planned and optimized using machine-learning algorithms.
For the purpose of this work the vehicle is assumed to only drive in reverse and to only have one trailer.
This work consists of:
-Research of relevant scientific literature
- Development of software for configuration and visualization purposes
- Choosing and implementing a Machine-Learning Algorithm into that software
- Evaluation of the chosen algorithm based on the paths it plans using the created software
(Use of the scale model is optional)
